We're seeing strong initial speed in the first sector/segment, but waiting for full lap data to confirm race pace against our 98.0s base.\n*   **Pit Window:** Hold Lap 10 pit. The known caution lines up perfectly for a \"free\" stop under yellow.\n*   **Caution:** No new caution projected for the next three laps. Our primary focus is executing the Lap 10 caution pit strategy.",
